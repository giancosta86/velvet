_Smooth, functional testing in the Elvish shell_

**velvet** is a minimalist - yet _sophisticated_ - **test framework** and **runner**, enabling its users to _run tests organized in hierarchical structures_ leveraging the _functional programming_ elegance of the [Elvish](https://elv.sh/) shell.

![Console summary](docs/console-summary.png)

## Why Velvet?

I am personally fond of the expressive, **Gherkin**-like syntax supported by testing infrastructures like [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) and [ScalaTest](https://www.scalatest.org/), but each of them is based on a specific language - which usually doesn't feel as _natural_ as a shell when dealing with _system aspects_ like files, networks or _inter-process communication_.

Given my passion for the [Elvish](https://elv.sh/) shell, I've designed this _testing architecture_ by combining my favorite aspects of such frameworks, while applying my own perspective - especially focused on _cross-technology integration scenarios_.

## Installation

Velvet can be installed via **epm** - in particular:

```elvish
use epm

epm:install github.com/giancosta86/velvet
```

## Setup

In **rc.elv**, it is recommended to add the following lines:

```elvish
use github.com/giancosta86/velvet/main velvet

var velvet~ = $velvet:velvet~
```

This will make the `velvet` command globally available at the command prompt.

## Writing tests

Tests are defined in **test scripts** - by convention, files having `.test.elv` extension: they are _standard Elvish scripts_ with a fundamental plus - they can also transparently invoke a handful of _additional builtin functions_, injected by Velvet and described in this section.

### Structuring the tests

The `>>` function is the basic building block for _defining the test tree_ - adopting _a Gherkin-like descriptive notation_:

```elvish
>> 'First component' {
  >> 'division operation' {
    >> 'when divisor is not 0' {
      >> 'should return value' {
        # Test code goes here
      }
    }

    >> 'when divisor is 0' {
      >> 'should crash' {
        # Test code goes here
      }
    }
  }
}

>> 'Second component' {
  >> 'other operation' {
    >> 'should work' {
      # Test code goes here
    }
  }
}
```

The innermost calls of `>>` define **tests**, which are the leaves in a tree of **sections**; in the example above, the tests are:

- **should return value**

- **should crash**

- **should work**

whereas all the other occurrences of `>>` define **sections** - and each section can include _tests_ and _sub-sections_.

**Please, note**: tests can also reside _in the root of the script_ - of course, when they are not contained in another `>>` block.

**Please, note**: the `>>` _function_ - called at the beginning of the line, has _no ambiguity_ with the `>>` _redirection operator_, which always appears _after a command_.

## Test outcome

A test can only have one of _two outcomes_:

- ✅**passed** if its block _ends with no exceptions_

- ❌**failed** if an exception was thrown; in particular, you can fail a test via Elvish's `fail` function, or via one of Velvet's _assertions_.

In the default console reporter, the **test output** - on both _stdout_ and _stderr_ - is displayed, together with the _exception log_, only _if the test fails_.

### Assertions

- `should-be [&strict] <expected>`: if the value passed via pipe (`|`) is not equal to the `<expected>` argument:

  1. Displays both values

  1. If the `diff` command is available on the system, also shows their differences

  1. Fails.

  To test a single variable, you can prepend the `put` function:

  ```elvish
  put $my-variable |
    should-be 90
  ```

  although, most frequently, you'll use a direct pipe:

  ```elvish
  my-command <arguments> |
    should-be <expected value>
  ```

  #### Equality

  In Velvet, _equality_ is defined as follows:

  - the **default behavior** consists in comparing via `eq` the _minimized representations_ of both operands.

    ```elvish
    # EQUAL!
    put 90 |
      should-be (num 90)
    ```

    **DEFINITION**: the _minimized representation_ for any value is defined as follows:

    - if the value is a **number**, it is the _string_ denoting the number

    - if the value is a **list**, it is a list whose items are the _minimized representations_ of its items

    - if the value is a **map**, it is a map whose keys and values are the _minimized representations_ of the keys and values

    - otherwise, it is _the value itself_

  - if `&strict` is requested, the `eq` function is applied to the pair of values.

    ```elvish
    # NOT EQUAL!
    put 90 |
      should-be &strict (num 90)
    ```

- `should-not-be [&strict] <unexpected>`: if the value passed via pipe (`|`) is equal to the `<unexpected>` argument:

  1. Displays such value

  1. Fails.

  ```elvish
  some-command <arguments> |
    should-not-be 90
  ```

  The input mechanism and the equality logic are the same as those described for `should-be`.

- `throws <block>`: requires `block` to _throw an exception_ - failing if it _completed successfully_.

  ```elvish
  # This works fine
  throws {
    fail DODO
  }

  # This will fail, saying a failure was expected!
  throws {
    # This block throws nothing
  }
  ```

  As a plus, the exception itself is _output as a value_, so it can be further inspected - especially via `get-fail-content`, which returns:

  - the value - usually _a message string_ - passed to the `fail` command

  - `$nil` if the input value was not an _exception_ thrown by `fail`

  For example:

  ```elvish
  throws {
    fail DODO
  } |
    get-fail-content |
    should-be DODO
  ```

- `fail-test` takes _no arguments_ and _always fails_ - with a predefined message: it's perfect for _quickly sketching out a new test_ in test iterations.

## Running tests

To run _all the tests_ within a directory containing _one or more test scripts_ in its _file system tree_, just run this command in the Elvish shell:

> velvet

The command can be customized via a few _optional parameters_:

- `&must-pass`: if _at least one test fails_, the command _throws an exception_. **Default**: disabled.

- `&reporters`: a list of _functions to report the test summary_; each reporter receives a `summary` map object - processing it as needed.

  **Default**: the reporter writing to the console with _colors_ and _emojis_.

- `&put`: outputs the summary to the _value channel_. In this case, you'll probably want to set `&reporters=[]` or to a list containing _reporters not writing to the console_ - or simply pipe to `only-values`.

  **Default**: disabled.

- `num-workers`: the (actually maximum) number of _parallel Elvish shells_ executing the test scripts. **Default**: 8.

The _requested script paths_ can also be passed as _variadic arguments_ to the `velvet` command:

```elvish
velvet <script 1> <script 2> ... <script N>
```

otherwise, _all the test scripts located in the directory tree_ below the current working directory will be run.

## Execution flow

![Execution flow](docs/execution-flow.png)

- _Every test script_ runs its tests **sequentially** - in a (virtually) _dedicated shell_: consequently, the _current working directory_ and other global variables can be changed with _no fear of interference_, as long as the script _sets their initial values_ as required.

- _Multiple test scripts_ are usually run **in parallel** - and _all the results are merged_ to a final **summary**, ready to be sent to the _requested reporters_ and/or emitted to Elvish's _value channel_.

  **Please, note**:

  - separate scripts can have _sections with the same titles_ - and _the test results will be merged_ as expected

  - on the other hand, _each test must have a unique path in the test tree_ - that is, the sequence of its **section titles** combined with its own **test title**; otherwise, _all the duplicate occurrences will be merged_ into a _single_ `DUPLICATE!` failing test result

## The default reporter

The _default reporter_ writes the overall **summary** to the _console_, with the following rules:

- In each section, **test results** come _before_ **sub-sections**

- **Test results** are shown in _alphabetical order_

- **Sections** are listed in _alphabetical order_, too

- The **stats** are displayed at the end

## Frequently asked questions

### Are there setup and teardown?

Nope, because **velvet** is designed to be _minimalist_ - and you can _achieve the same results_ via the Elvish language:

- **setup** can be replaced by _a factory function_ - often with _closures_

- **teardown** can be replaced by _a dedicated higher-order function_ with a _block argument_ - executing it within a `try`/`finally` structure or in a `defer`-based context

### `echo`, `print`, `pprint` and other functions have no output: why?

In the _default console reporter_, **successful tests do not output their stdout/stderr**, by design.

Should you need further inspection, you can make the test fail just by adding a call to `fail-test` - which takes no arguments.

### Is there a recommended style to structure the tests?

The user is _absolutely free_: the system only provides the `>>` function to _create nodes in the test tree_: all the rest depends on the specific _expressive requirements_ - which _could change from one test script to another_ or even _within the same script_.

### Why are the tests not in the same order as in my script?

Because they are _alphabetically sorted_ by the default console reporter - a choice stemming from the fact that, in Velvet, _sections can span multiple test scripts_, as required by the _testing style_ or by the _isolation needs_ in terms of global variables like the _current working directory_.
