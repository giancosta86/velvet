# velvet

_Smooth, functional testing in the Elvish shell_

## Installation

Velvet can be installed via **epm** - for example:

```elvish
use epm

epm:install github.com/giancosta86/velvet
```

## Setup

In **rc.elv**, it is recommended to add the following lines:

```elvish
use github.com/giancosta86/velvet/main velvet

var velvet~ = $velvet:velvet~
```

## Running tests

To run tests from a directory containing one or more test scripts in its tree, just run this command in the Elvish shell:

> velvet

The command can be customized with a few optional parameters:

- `&test-scripts`: a list of paths to the test scripts to be run; by default, any **.test.elv** file beneath the current directory node is selected

- `&reporters`: an array of functions to report test results and stats; the default is a function writing to the console.

  Each reporter function should receive:

  - a `describe-result` object

  - a `stats` object

  with no additional constraints.
